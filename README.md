# Improve usage of unsupervised data for the definition of RUL-based maintenance policies
This is the final project for the Artificial Intelligence in Industry course at UniBo.

In the recent years, industries such as aeronautical, railway, and petroleum has transitioned from corrective or preventive maintenance to condition based maintenance (CBM). One of the enablers of CBM is Prognostics which primarily deals with prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) of an engineering asset. Besides physics-based approaches, data driven methods are widely used for prognostics purposes, however the latter technique requires availability of run to failure datasets. In this project we show a method to inject external knowledge into the deep learning model to exploit data about the normal functioning of the machines. We apply our approach on the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) model developed at NASA.
